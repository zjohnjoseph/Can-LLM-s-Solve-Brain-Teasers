The other options don't quite fit:  B) A comic book typically contains images and text, but not music notes.  C) A fiction book typically contains text, but not music notes.

Riddle: I sum six by eleven and get five. Why is this the case?


Options:
A) Because we are talking the computer.
B) Because we are talking the price.
C) Because we are talking the time.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  B) Because we are talking the price.  Here's my reasoning:  * "I sum six by eleven" means adding 6 and 11 together, which equals 17. * "and get five" means that the result (17) is often referred to as "five dollars" in some contexts (e.g., $5).  So, the riddle is playing with the idea that the result of the sum is often represented as a price (five dollars), rather than the actual numerical value (17).  Am I correct?
Answer: B
Correct: C
Wrong!

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  The correct option is: B) Remove the end N and add A,D and M.  The riddle is playing with words, and the answer is a pun. The three letters "MAN" become "MADE", which means "to make" or "to turn into", and in this case, "to turn a man into a female" (a woman).  So, if you remove the end "N" from "MAN" and add "A", "D", and "M" to the beginning, you get "MADE", which is the answer to the riddle.  Am I correct?
Answer: B
Correct: B
Right!

Riddle: How do you make the manager angry?

Options:
A) Take away the 'e'.
B) Take away the 'r'.
C) Take away the 'm'.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  A) Take away the 'e'.  Why? Because "make the manager" becomes "make manager", which is a common way to refer to a manager, without the word "make"! So, by removing the 'e', you're effectively "taking away" the "make" part, leaving only "manager".  Am I correct?
Answer: A
Correct: C
Wrong!

Answer: B
Correct: B
Right!

C) The rightside.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  B) The outside.

C) Wading pool.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above.

As a result, it's less likely to get dirty or require cleaning, as there's no splashing or debris generated by swimmers.  Am I correct?
Answer: A
Correct: B
Wrong!

Riddle: What's the beginning of everything?

Options:
A) The letter T.
B) The letter G.

D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  The correct option is C) The letter E.  Here's my reasoning: "The beginning of everything" could be interpreted as the start of a word, and the most common prefix in many words is "E-" (e.g., "every", "exist", "echo", etc.). Therefore, the letter E is the beginning of many words, making it the "beginning of everything".  Am I correct?
Answer: C
Correct: C
Right!

Riddle: What kind of butter is really able to fly?

Options:
A) Almond butter.
B) Peanut butter.
C) Butterfly.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  C) Butterfly.  The riddle is playing with words, using "butter" as a noun (the insect) instead of a verb (to spread on food). A butterfly is able to fly, whereas butter (the food) is not.  So, I choose option C) Butterfly. Am I correct?
Answer: C
Correct: C
Right!

Riddle: What TV show should people in serious denial watch ?

Options:
A) Reality TV shows
B) Sports live.
C) Soap operas.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  C) Soap operas.  The reasoning is that people in serious denial often have a hard time accepting reality, and soap operas are known for their over-the-top, melodramatic storylines that often defy reality. Watching soap operas might be a way for someone in denial to escape into a fantasy world where everything works out in the end, and the characters' problems are always resolved in a tidy, unrealistic way. Am I correct?
Answer: C
Correct: A
Wrong!

Riddle: What is the sum of 3/7 chicken, 2/3 cat, and 2/4 goat?

Options:
A) California.
B) Chicago.
C) Texas.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  Let's break it down:  * 3/7 chicken = 3 parts out of 7 that are chicken * 2/3 cat = 2 parts out of 3 that are cat * 2/4 goat = 2 parts out of 4 that are goat  Now, let's combine the fractions:  (3/7) + (2/3) + (2/4)  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 84. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 84:  (21/84) + (56/84) + (42/84)  Adding these, we get:  (119/84)  Now, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:  (17/12)  So, the sum of 3/7 chicken, 2/3 cat, and 2/4 goat is 17/12.  None of the options provided (A) California, (B) Chicago, (C) Texas, or (D) None of above) matches the answer. Therefore, the correct answer is:  D) None of above.
Answer: D
Correct: B
Wrong!

Voilà! You've created a number greater than 2 but less than 3 between the numbers 3 and 2 using a mathematical symbol.
Answer: A

Riddle: At the start of eternity, the end of time and space, the beginning of every end, and the end of every race, what is discovered?

Options:
A) The letter 'E'.
B) The letter 'B'.
C) The letter 'R'.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  The correct option is A) The letter 'E'.  Here's my reasoning:  * "At the start of eternity" suggests the beginning of something infinite or infinite in the past. * "The end of time and space" suggests a point where time and space cease to exist. * "The beginning of every end" is a bit tricky, but I think it means the start of the end of something, which is a common phrase. * "And the end of every race" suggests the finish line of a competition or the conclusion of a journey.  Putting it all together, I think the answer is the letter 'E', which is often used to represent the end of a word, the end of a sentence, or the end of a phrase. It's also the letter that appears at the end of the word "eternity".  Am I correct?
Answer: A
Correct: A
Right!

Riddle: What is seen in the midst of March and April that is not visible at the start or end of each month?

Options:
A) The letter R.
B) The letter I.
C) The letter A.
D) None of above.

Please select the correct option that answers the riddle above. 
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  The correct option is:  A) The letter R.  Here's my reasoning:  * In the midst of March and April, the letter R is indeed visible, as it is the third letter in both month names (Mar-ch and Ap-ril). * However, at the start of March and April, the letter R is not visible, as it is not the first letter in either month name. * Similarly, at the end of March and April, the letter R is not visible, as it is not the last letter in either month name.  So, the letter R is only visible in the midst of March and April, making option A the correct answer.  Am I correct?
Answer: A
Correct: A
Right!
