Answer: 
Response: A nice pattern recognition question!  Let's analyze the information:  * Pink University is constructed of Pink bricks. * Blue University is constructed of Blue bricks. * Yellow University is constructed of Blue bricks.

Now, let's consider Brown University. We don't have any information about its bricks, but we can make an educated guess based on the pattern. Since Yellow University is constructed of Blue bricks, it's possible that Brown University is constructed of a different color of bricks, but not necessarily Brown bricks.  The correct answer is:  D) None of above.
