B) Take away the 'e'.
C) Take away the 'i'.
D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)

Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)

So, the letter "I" is at the beginning of eternity and the end of time!  Am I correct?
Answer: A
Correct: B
Wrong!

Riddle: What plants can not photosyntheszie but can produce energy.
Options:
A) A wetland plant.
B) A nuclear plant.
C) An aquatic plant.
D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I'm going to choose... B) A nuclear plant.  The reason is that a nuclear plant (like a power plant) uses nuclear reactions to generate energy, which doesn't involve photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy). So, a nuclear plant can produce energy without photosynthesizing.  Am I correct?
Answer: A
Correct: B
Wrong!

Riddle: What alphabet letters arrive after suppertime?

C) Those that come after T.
D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  After some thought, I think I have the answer:  C) Those that come after T.  The reasoning is that "suppertime" ends with the letter T, so the alphabet letters that arrive after suppertime are those that come after T, which are U, V, W, X, Y, and Z.  So, I choose option C) Those that come after T.
Answer: C
Correct: C
Right!

Riddle: Which plants are incapable of photosynthesizing?
Options:
A) A house plant
B) A power plant.
C) An indoor plant.
D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  The answer is D) None of above.  Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose. All plants, regardless of whether they are indoor or outdoor, are capable of photosynthesizing.  A house plant, an indoor plant, or a power plant (which is not a type of plant at all, but a facility that generates electricity) can all undergo photosynthesis.  So, the correct answer is D) None of above.
Answer: D
Correct: B
Wrong!

D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  I'm going to choose... D) None of above.  My reasoning is that the options provided are all wordplay or clever twists, but none of them are actually "ineligible" for cheese feeding. A computer mouse isn't a type of mouse that eats cheese, a hungry mouse might still eat cheese, and an old mouse might still have a taste for cheese. So, the correct answer is that none of the above options are actually ineligible for cheese feeding.
Answer: A
Correct: A
Right!

Riddle: Pink Univerisity is constructed of Pink bricks, Blue Univerisity is constructed of blue bricks, Yellow Univerisity is constructed of blue bricks, what kind of bricks in Brown University?
Options:
A) Mix of pink,blue and yellow.
B) Blue
C) Brown.
D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  Let's analyze the given information:  * Pink University is constructed of Pink bricks. * Blue University is constructed of Blue bricks. * Yellow University is constructed of Blue bricks.  Notice that Yellow University is constructed of Blue bricks, not Yellow bricks. This suggests that the color of the university does not necessarily match the color of the bricks.  Now, considering Brown University, we can conclude that:  * It's not constructed of Pink bricks (as Pink University is). * It's not constructed of Blue bricks (as Blue University and Yellow University are). * It's not constructed of Yellow bricks (as Yellow University is constructed of Blue bricks). * It's not constructed of a mix of pink, blue, and yellow bricks (as that would be a contradictory statement).  The only remaining option is:  C) Brown.  So, the correct answer is C) Brown.
Answer: C

Wrong!

Riddle: How did the zookeeper repair the leaking facet?

D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  I think I have the answer: D) None of above.  The reason is that a "monkey wrench" is a type of adjustable wrench, and "stubby wrench" is a type of wrench with a short handle. So, the options A, B, and C are all types of wrenches, but the question asks how the zookeeper repaired a "leaking facet", which is likely a faucet (a device that controls the flow of water).  Therefore, the correct answer is D) None of above, as the zookeeper would likely need a different type of tool or expertise to repair a leaking faucet, rather than a wrench.

Riddle: What is the sum of 3/7 chicken, 2/3 cat, and 2/4 goat?
Options:
A) California.
B) Chicago.
C) Texas.
D) None of above.
Choose the correct answer:
(Select one of the above options by typing A, B, C, or D)
Response: A clever riddle!  Let's break it down:  * 3/7 chicken = 3 parts out of 7 are chicken. That means 4 parts are not chicken (since 3 + 4 = 7). * 2/3 cat = 2 parts out of 3 are cat. That means 1 part is not cat (since 2 + 1 = 3). * 2/4 goat = 2 parts out of 4 are goat. That means 2 parts are not goat (since 2 + 2 = 4).  Now, let's combine the parts that are not chicken, cat, or goat: 4 (not chicken) + 1 (not cat) + 2 (not goat) = 7.  So, the sum is... 7!  And, surprisingly, 7 is the number of letters in the word "CHICKEN"!
